# Simple face landmarks detection with MediaPipe

This is an example how to use the face landmark detection model with MediaPipe. Find the full description of the model [here.](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker)

To run this project you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your machine. The project was set up with [vite](https://vite.dev/).

npm run dev
```

### Use the detections

To use the detection you can access the `detections` object in the `processResults` function. You can find this function in `src/js/script.js`

```javascript
function processResults(detections) {
  landmarksContainer.innerHTML = "";

  if (detections.faceLandmarks && detections.faceLandmarks[0]?.length) {
    // USE THE LANDMARKS HERE â†“
    for (let i = 0; i < detections.faceLandmarks[0].length; i++) {
      // extract the landmark from the array
      const landmark = detections.faceLandmarks[0][i];

      const x = videoWidth * (1 - landmark.x);
      const y = videoHeight * landmark.y;
      drawKeypoint(x, y, null);
    }
  }
}
```
